# Canvas Desktop Reminders
 This is a simple program I'm making for myself to be able to be reminded on my desktop of upcoming assignments in Canvas LMS. As of right now, to the best of my knowledge,
 no Canvas desktop integration or programs exist, and I think it would be neat to receive unintrusive reminders that I have to do things.

 Note: This is only built to work on Windows. I don't know how to work it on other OS's, unfortunately.
